            <p>The department for Education will now get in contact with these schools so that they can confirm your partnership.</p>
            <p>You can find out whether these schools have confirmed your partnership on <a href="/declare-partnership/multiple/success-journey/supplier-landing">your dashboard</a>. We recommend that you prompt
            a school if they take more than a week to confirm the relationship.</p>
