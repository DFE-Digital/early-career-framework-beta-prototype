<p>Dear provider,</p>


<p>You can now use the Early Career Framework provider dashboard to <strong>find schools to recruit</strong> and <strong>update us on your new contracts</strong></p>

<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>search for schools and school groups (like multi academy trusts or federations)</li>
    <li>find schools by location </li>
    <li>target schools that are remote or have a pupil premium over 40%</li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>And when youâ€™ve signed a contract with a school...</strong></p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>add your new contract details to ECF</li>
